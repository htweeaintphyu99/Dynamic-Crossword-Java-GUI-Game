# Dynamic-Crossword-Java-GUI-Game
For learning purposes, given a set of questions and answers related to English, Computer Science and General Knowledge, a crossword is generated dynamically and displayed for the user to play and learn. It was implemented using GUI, Java and MySQL as a special project during the fourth academic year.

The user must select at least one of the desired subjects and fill in the number of clues to make a crossword (The number of clues must be between 25 and 70). Only after that, the user can click the 'Play' button and play. 


These are draft interfaces of the crossword game.
